\begin{abstract}
 This paper describes the design, development and evaluation of a machine
 translation system between Dutch and Afrikaans developed over a period of
 around a month.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item languages, machine translation, existing work
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}

The system is based on the Apertium machine translation platform.\footnote{\url{http://www.apertium.org}} The
platform was originally aimed at the Romance languages of the Iberian
peninsula, but has also been adapted for other, more distantly related,
language pairs. The whole platform, both programs and data, are licensed
under the Free Software Foundation's General Public
Licence\footnote{\url{http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html}} (GPL)
and all the software and data for the 25 supported language pairs (and the
other pairs being worked on) is available for download from the project
website.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Existing resources}

One existing resource was reused with very little modification, that is the 
morphological analyser for Afrikaans created during a separate project on English--Afrikaans
machine translation. Some changes were made. The structure of verb entries
was wholly revised, and infrequent words were removed.

\subsection{Resources created}

\subsubsection{Dutch morphological analyser}

The open categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) for the Dutch 
morphological analyser were extracted semi-automatically from 
Wiktionary,\footnote{\url{http://www.wiktionary.org}} a free online 
dictionary that often includes inflectional information. In the case 
of Dutch nouns it often (although not always) gives the gender and the 
plural and diminutive forms (see for example Figure~\ref{fig:wikt1}).
The category {\small {\tt Dutch nouns}} has a total of 10,610 entries,
while the corresponding category on the Dutch Wiktionary has 13,176 entries.

Closed categories were added by hand based on a grammar of Dutch \cite{Shetter:02}.

    {\small \url{http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hoofdstad}}}
\label{fig:wikt1}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Bilingual dictionary}

\begin{itemize}
\item wikipedia, wiktionary, cognates
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Transfer rules}

\subsubsection{Compound words}


Both Afrikaans and Dutch are languages in which words combine very
productively into compounds. For example the words {\em infrastruktuurontwikkelingsplan}
`infrastructure development plan' and {\em personeelverminderingsprosedure}
`personnel protection procedure'. As it is impractical to introduce
all compound words into the lexicons, compound word analysis is performed on
all unknown words. The analysis process works longest-match left-to-right
using the same transducer as is used for morphological analysis.
Results are restricted by two special
symbols which do not appear in the output {\small {\tt compound-L}} and {\small {\tt compound-R}}.
The {\small {\tt compound-L}} symbol is used for forms that can only appear on the
left side (e.g. surface form) of a compound, where {\small {\tt compound-R}} is
used for forms that can either appear in a compound, or end it.
Epenthetics, that is linking letters that occur between compound words
are also taken care of heuristically in this way. For example the -s-
in ontwikkelingsplan or the -e- in EXAMPLE.


\begin{figure*}
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
die personeelverminderingsprosedure

^die<det><def><sg>$
^personeel<n><sg><cmp>+vermindering<n><sg><cmp>+prosedure<n><sg>$

^de<det><ind><mf><sg>$
^personeel<n><nt><sg><cmp>$^terugdringing<n><f><sg><cmp>$^procedure<n><mf><sg>$

de personeelterugdringingsprocedure
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
\end{figure*}

There are some limitations to this method. For example although
both {\em ontwikkeling-} and {\em ontwikkelings-} can be analysed as an internal part
of a compound, only one of them can be generated. Which one will be generated
is decided based on the inflectional paradigm to which the word belongs. For
example {\small {\tt ontwikkeling$<$n$><$sg$><$cmp$>$}} will produce {\em ontwikkelings-} in generation,
where {\small {\tt personeel$<$n$><$sg$><$cmp$>$}} will produce personeel.

\subsubsection{Separable verbs}

Another feature of Afrikaans and Dutch is separable verbs, for example
the Afrikaans {\em uitgaan} `to go out'. This can appear in the following
forms {\em uitgaan}, {\em gaan uit}, {\em uitgegaan}. Additionally the two constituent
parts of the verb in {\em gaan uit}, the verb itself {\em gaan} and the particle
{\em uit} may be separated by a word or phrase, {\em Ek gaan na die strand 
uit} `I go out to the beach'.

The following cases are supported,

\begin{itemize}
\item Infinitive: uitgaan $\rightarrow$ uitgaan
\item Participle: uitgegaan $\rightarrow$ uitgegaan
\item Non-separated: Ik ga uit naar het strand vandaag $\rightarrow$
\item Subordinate: Hoe in de klas het licht uitging $\rightarrow$
\end{itemize}

Verbs separated by a word or phrase are currently translated word-for-word,
so the particle and verb are translated. This causes a problem when the
verb is not constructed equally in Afrikaans and Dutch. Also, when one part
of the verb, for example in {\em aankondig} `to announce' does not exist as
a stand-alone verb, {\em kondig} is not a word. Thus {\em ... kondig ... aan} `'
cannot be analysed currently.

A module is under development to handle separable verbs, but is currently
in the prototype stage.

There are currently 484 separable verbs defined in the bilingual
dictionary. Of these, 439 are separable in both languages, 33 are
separable in Afrikaans but not in Dutch, and 12 are separable in
Dutch but not Afrikaans.

\subsection{Current status}

Dutch monolingual: 5,895
Afrikaans monolingual: 6,285
Bilingual: 5,813

\section{Evaluation}

The systems were evaluated in four ways. The first was the 
coverage\footnote{Here coverage is defined as \emph{na\"ive coverage}, 
that is for any given surface form at least one analysis is returned. This 
may not be complete.} of the system. The second was the word error 
rate (WER) of the translations produced when comparing with a 
corrected sentence. The third was an analysis of the errors found by the second
evaluation and finally a comparative evaluation with existing systems.

\subsection{Coverage}

Lexical coverage of the system is calculated over the Afrikaans and Dutch Wikipedias:
Both corpora were split into four sections and coverage calculated over each of the 
sections in order to calculate the standard deviation.

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|}
   \hline
   {\bf Corpus}           & {\bf Tokens}    & {\bf Coverage}\\
   \hline
   {\tt af} Wikipedia     & 2,926,943       & 82.1\% $\pm$ 0.8 \\
   \hline
   {\tt nl} Wikipedia     & 18,569,183      & 78.3\% $\pm$ 0.85 \\
   \hline
  \end{tabular}
